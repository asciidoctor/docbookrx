== TODO TASKS

=== TRACKED TODO TASKS

NOTE: All issues in this section have a matching tracker bug created in this project to contain work and contributions.

- only use nested elements on listitem if first element in paragraph; otherwise, treat as inline text
- create proper API; tuck inside a Ruby module
- set default attributes for article doctype
- add option to drop role names for literals
- implement variablelist children
- implement inline formatting in table cell content
- implement citetitle and attribute on blockquote
- list continuation doesn't get added if literallayout is delimited (bug)
- implement qanda list (i.e., qandaset)
- implement callouts (i.e, calloutlist)
- implement list IDs
- implement nested lists (currently using same level)
- text after variablelist inside same paragraph gets adjoined to text of last item (bug)
- don't start output document with blank line if input document does not start with section

=== UNTRACKED TODO NOTES

NOTE: All issues in this section are pending tracker bug creation, and will be converted in subsequent backlog grooming sessions.

- introduce entity_ref?, comment?, pi? methods instead of comparing type to a constant (mixin if necessary)
- make level shifting configurable (or auto-detectable?)
- make dsl block for adjoining children inside delimited block
- handle preface correctly
- honor table width
- honor table col widths
- implement verse blockquote
- make character used for emphasis quoting an option
- make literal paragraph indent size an option
- try to set leveloffset only once
- try to use + for literal (passthrough) when possible
- find cleaner solution for skipping title node
- make a function for detecting need for unconstrained formatting marks

== Test cases

* unordered / ordered list with complex content
* nested lists
* description lists
* uses double `` if literal phrase is surrounded by a word character (before, after or both)
* retrieves section title from either first child named title or title child of info
* honors sentence_per_line option
* auto-generates ids for sections
* handles id override on section
* follows xi:include elements in section content
* replaces xi:include with include macro in programlisting
