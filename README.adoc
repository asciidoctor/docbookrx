{project-name} (gem: *{project-handle}*) is the prescription (℞) you need to get rid of your DocBook pain.
This tool converts DocBook XML (hell) to AsciiDoc.

{project-name} is the start of a {uri-docbook}[DocBook] to {uri-asciidoc}[AsciiDoc] converter written in Ruby.
This converter is far from perfect at the moment and some of the conversion is done hastily.
The plan is to evolve it into a robust library for performing this conversion in a reliable way.

== Installing the Development Version

Currently, {project-name} is only available in source form.
You'll need to retrieve the source and run the application out the source directory.

=== Retrieve the Source Code

Simply copy the {uri-repo}[GitHub repository URL] and pass it to the `git clone` command:

[subs=attributes+]
 $ git clone {uri-repo}

Next, switch to the project directory:

[subs=attributes+]
 $ cd {project-handle}

=== Prepare RVM (optional)

We recommend using {uri-rvm}[RVM] when developing applications with Ruby.
Follow the {uri-rvm-install}[installation instructions] on the RVM site to setup RVM and install Ruby.

Once you have RVM setup, we recommend creating a new gemset to work with {project-name}:

[subs=attributes+]
 $ rvm use default@{project-handle}-dev --create

We like RVM because it keeps the dependencies required by various projects isolated from each other and from your system.

=== Install the Dependencies

The dependencies needed to use {project-name} are defined in the [path]_Gemfile_ at the root of the project.
You'll use Bundler to install these dependencies.

To check if you have Bundler available, use the `bundle` command to query the version installed:

 $ bundle --version

If it's not installed, use the `gem` command to install it.

 $ gem install bundler

Next, configure the `bundle` command (provided by the bundler gem) to use the system-wide Nokogiri library if available, which dramatically cuts down on installation time:

 $ bundle config --local build.nokogiri --use-system-libraries

Finally, use the `bundle` command (which is provided by the bundler gem) to install the dependencies into the project:

 $ bundle --path=.bundle/rubygems

NOTE: You must invoke `bundle` from the project's root directory so it can locate the [path]_Gemfile_.

IMPORTANT: Since we've installed dependencies inside the project, it's necessary to prefix all commands (e.g., rake and docbookrx) with `bundle exec`.

== Running the Converter

To run the converter, execute the launch script and pass a DocBook file to convert as the first argument.

 $ bundle exec docbookrx sample.xml

The script will automatically create the output file [path]_sample.adoc_, replacing the DocBook file extension, `.xml` with the AsciiDoc file extension, `.adoc`.

The converter is not perfect yet, but we'll get there with your help.
You'll can find a list of tasks that need attention listed in the WORKLOG.adoc file.

=== Conditional attribute

The DocBook conditional attribute "condition" is replaced to "ifdef" macro.

Take note the marco is on a line by itself.

For example, in the case of there is the DocBook inline element with condition.

 a<phrase condition="foo">b</phrase>c

It is converted to below AsciiDoc format.

 a
 ifdef::foo[]
 b
 endif::foo[]
 c

When it is converted to html format, the output is displayed with both a space before "b" and a space after "b".

 a b c
